      <h2>Sound Monitoring Systems</h2>
      <p>This system continuously monitors ambient noise levels using a microphone sensor. The
Raspberry Pi calculates the sound intensity and sends real-time data to a client application. If
the measured noise exceeds a preset threshold (for example, 80 dB), the system triggers an
alert, helping manage environments sensitive to noise levels such as classrooms or industrial
settings. (implement communication between raspberry pi and computer/ mobile device using UDP (User Datagram Protocol) ).

      <h2>AI Chatbot</h2>
      <p>This project is based on Analysis Canvas and Stanford's d.school design thinking methodology. We were a given a health challenge CHS workers at UWC facing, particularly around the uptake and understanding of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEp), a medication used to prevent HIV infection.

        Problem: Despite PrEP being freely available in South Africa, uptake remains low due to; stigma, misinformation, inaccessibility due to crowded clinics and lack of outreach, and cultural and systemic barriers.

        The solution was to design an AI-chatbot that educates users on PrEp, answers common questions anonymously, and offer support in a non-judgemental, digital format.

        <h2>Multiple Linear Regression Model Project</h2> 
        <p>
           This project aims to identify which blood tests serve as effective predictors of alcohol consumption, which is a key risk factor for liver disorders. The dataset provided contains 276 records of male individuals and includes results from five specific blood tests along with the average number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day (the target variable). A subset of this data (80% sample) is used for analysis.

The main goal is to build a multiple linear regression model to determine the predictive power of various liver function indicatorsâ€”namely:

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)

Alkaline phosphatase (Alkphos)

Alanine aminotransferase (SGPT)

Aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT)

Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)

The variable "Drinks" serves as the outcome measure, representing the number of half-pint equivalents of alcohol consumed per day. The variable "Selector" is used to distinguish training and testing sets within the dataset.
