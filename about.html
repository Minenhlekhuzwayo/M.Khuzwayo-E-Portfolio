      <p>I'm Minenhle Khuzwayo, a 3rd year Computer Science student at UWC. I chose to study Computer Science because I enjoy solving problems and making a difference. Growing up in a semi-rural area, I saw how many people were unfamiliar with technology and saw it as something complicated or out of reach. I want to change that by making technology simple, accessible, and useful in solving everyday problems in the community.

I've already started working toward this goal. For example, my team and I developed an AI chatbot that provides information about PrEP. It helps clear up confusion and stigma, and even directs users to the right departments if they need more support. The best part is that people can access all this information from home—saving them the cost and time of traveling to clinics or standing in long queues for something that could be done on a phone or computer.

You can learn more about this project and others I’ve worked on on the next page.
